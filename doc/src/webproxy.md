# Varnish (Webproxy)

This role provides Varnish Cache, the high-performance HTTP accelerator, in the latest version provided by NixOS which is 7.4.x at the moment.

## How we differ from what you are used to

Here is how we differ from what you already know from common Linux distributions
and how you are used to configure, start, stop and maintain these packages.

- **configuration file locations:**

  Since we use NixOS, configuration files have to be edited in
  {file}`/etc/local/nixos`, followed by a NixOS rebuild which copies them into
  the Nix store and activates the new configuration. To do so, run the command
  {command}`sudo fc-manage --build`.

- **service control:**

  We use {command}`systemd` to control processes. You can use familiar commands
  like {command}`sudo systemctl restart varnish` to control services.
  However, remember that invoking {command}`sudo fc-manage --build` is
  necessary to put configuration changes into effect. A simple restart is not
  sufficient. For further information, also see {ref}`nixos-local`.

### Role configuration

The role currently supports two different ways to configure Varnish.
Please note that all configuration has to be performed as a service user.

The recommended way is to use Nix. For an overview of the available configuration
options, see the Varnish module in our [infrastructure repository](https://github.com/flyingcircusio/fc-nixos).
As with all NixOS modules, put your configuration into an appropriately named file
in the {file}`/etc/local/nixos` directory, e.g. {file}`/etc/local/nixos/varnish.nix`.

You can also put your verbatim Varnish configuration into {file}`/etc/local/varnish/default.vcl`.
Please note that this way of configuring Varnish is deprecated and will likely
be removed in the future.

The role passes a handful of command line arguments to Varnish to
ensure reasonable default behaviour. If you wish to pass extra command
line arguments to Varnish, then you should use the provided
`flyingcircus.services.varnish.extraCommandLine` NixOS
option. Arguments specified using this option (which may be defined
multiple times) will be merged into the list of arguments passed to
Varnish along with the role defaults.

### Monitoring

- We monitor that the varnishd process is running.

- Please add a custom http checks which suite your needs to to {file}`/etc/local/sensu-client`, for instance:

  ```
  {
    "varnish": {
      "command": "check_http -H localhost -p 8080",
      "notification" : "varnish broken",
      "interval": 120,
      "standalone": true
    }
  }
  ```
